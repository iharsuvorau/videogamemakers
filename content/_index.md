## Are you running a video game project that has received public funding in Australia or in the UK?

If so, your experience could contribute to this PhD research. The study examines how public funding influences indie video game studios, including solo developers. It compares the impacts on video game teams in Australia and the UK, which exemplify two distinct funding approaches.

### Interested in contributing? 

Please send a short message to Raman Voranau, a PhD scholar at the University of South Australia, [raman.voranau@mymail.unisa.edu.au](mailto:raman.voranau@mymail.unisa.edu.au).

## Research Question

How does participation in funding programmes contribute to innovation, inclusion, and the sustainability of careers and businesses within small to medium-sized video game studios?

## Significance of the Study

### Justification

Project-based work in the creative industries is often unsustainable, exacerbating inequalities and precarity (Eikhof, 2020; Eikhof & Warhurst, 2013). Indie video game studios can potentially offer better control over intellectual property, improved gender inclusion, and accelerated innovation (Keogh, 2021; Tsang, 2021; Weststar & Legault, 2018). However, the combination of artistic, commercial, and technological demands in video game production poses significant challenges to individuals aiming to build sustainable careers or businesses in the industry (Snowball et al., 2021; Tschang, 2007).

Public programmes are designed to enhance working conditions in the video game industry, promoting inclusion, innovation, and business sustainability while generating broader societal benefits (Kerr, 2017; Perks & Whitson, 2022). Given the changeable nature of the video game industry and the diverse policies governing it, contextual factors vary significantly across countries (Kerr, 2017). A comparative approach can reveal best practices for fostering business sustainability in creative industries and illustrate how public funding benefit small and medium-sized video game studios (Cohendet et al., 2020).

### Research Contribution

This study responds to calls for exploring new dimensions of inclusion, innovation, and business sustainability in indie studios across different national contexts (Perks & Whitson, 2022; Weststar & Legault, 2018; Miozzo et al., 2023). These issues are especially relevant within the tension between creativity and rationality in the industry.

### Comparative Context 

The study compares video game production in Australia and the UK, two countries with distinct funding policy frameworks. In line with its recent cultural policy approach, Australia’s funding initiatives primarily view video games as a form of artistic expression (Commonwealth of Australia, 2023; Keogh, 2023). The UK funding policies, while recognising the role of creativity, place significant emphasis on the economic output, as well as the innovative and technological significance of the video game industry (Webber, 2020; Mullen et al., 2022; Meyrick, 2024).

The research aims to identify the nuanced effects of public funding on video game studios and how these outcomes differ across the two national contexts.
