title: "About the project"
---

This website is dedicated to my research project undertaken at the University of South Australia. I interview video game makers, asking them about the following things:

* how your leisure looks like,
* what activities you prefer,
* why they are valuable for you.

Although someone could assume that ‘game’ is a key for the responses, the reality is much richer.

## Why is this important?

1. Participation in a range of leisure activities contributes in [different ways](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9435-x). Customising our free time, we can achieve more meaningful leisure experiences. Particularly, I am interested in how participation in culture and arts influence people from creative jobs.

2. Typical leisure activities can vary for people from [different occupations](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038518772737). Despite the growing community of game makers, the topic of meaningful leisure for them is understudied.

3. For cultural workers, it is often [hard to define](http://www.e-flux.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2.-Maurizio-Lazzarato-Immaterial-Labor.pdf) where the work ends, and free time starts. The pandemic blurred border between work and leisure, even more, raising the value of meaningful leisure experiences.

## Are you related to South Australia’s video game industry?

I would love to hear your thoughts. Please, let me know by either way mentioned in the end. Alternatively, fill the [3-minutes online form here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C5J2WBW), and I will contact you.

## Do you know anyone from the community?

Please, send them the link on this website. I will be happy to interview game makers who are willing to improve the understanding of their leisure experiences.

## Are you related to the video game industry outside South Australia?

Contact me as I am also interested in your leisure experiences. It will help me to crystallise what is significant for those game makers based in South Australia.

## The last thing

I will present my results. Rigorously for journals. Highlights for the media. All together plus anecdotes in special presentations for the study participants.
