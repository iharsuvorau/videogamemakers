title: "About the project"
---

This website is dedicated to my research project undertaken at the University of South Australia. I am interviewing videogame developers to ask you about the following things:

* What does your leisure look like?
* What leisure activities do you prefer?
* What are the leisure activities valuable to you?

## Why is this important?

1. The global health pandemic has affected work and leisure activities. It is further blurring the border between work and leisure, causing us to question the value of [meaningful](https://theconversation.com/exhausted-by-2020-here-are-5-ways-to-recover-and-feel-more-rested-throughout-2021-152608s) leisure experiences.

2. Leisure activities contribute in [different ways](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9435-x) to reducing stress, creating quality of life and enhancing well-being. You can achieve more meaningful leisure experiences, [customising](https://theconversation.com/exhausted-by-2020-here-are-5-ways-to-recover-and-feel-more-rested-throughout-2021-152608) your free time. I am interested in how you do that as a person in a creative role.

3. Typical leisure activities [can vary](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038518772737) for people from different occupations. Meaningful leisure activities can be specific for a video game developer.

## Are you engaged with the Australia's video game industry?

## How else could you help?

## How can I help?

This project will benefit you because I am happy to send a copy of the report or provide you with informal feedback on conducting meaningful leisure activities in a global pandemic. 

I will also share with you the publications from this study that might interest you.
