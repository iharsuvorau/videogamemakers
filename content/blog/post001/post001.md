Painting, drawing, weaving, digital art from self-taught artists and those with background are well-detached from the rest of the gallery by the range of the knitted emotions. It is like you come back to your parents after a long time and have a talk in a family circle on various topics. The conversation can be sad or joyful, relaxed and easy-going or serious and making you silent, but it avoids any extremes because you are not teen anymore. 

Communication with like-minded people is a substantial part of the art workshops supporting people on their way to better mental well-being. Probably, this is the reason why the exhibition is literally breathing with sociality. 

The exhibition *The Art in Heart* is available for visitors until 28 August. Kerry Packer Civic Gallery is open Mon–Fri 9am–5pm, Thu until 7pm. Most works are available for purchasing.
