      <description>Kerry Packer Civic Gallery within The Bob Hawk Centre in UniSA accommodates exhibition The Art in Heart. Neami National, a service improving well-being of people living with mental health issues, provides here artworks of 20+ creators in different techniques, medium, and styles.
Painting, drawing, weaving, digital art from self-taught artists and those with background are well-detached from the rest of the gallery by the range of the knitted emotions. It is like you come back to your parents after a long time and have a talk in a family circle on various topics.</description>
