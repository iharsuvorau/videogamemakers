      <description>This website is dedicated to my research project undertaken at the University of South Australia. I interview video game makers, asking them about the following things:
 how your leisure looks like, what activities you prefer, why they are valuable for you.  Although someone could assume that ‘game’ is a key for the responses, the reality is much richer.
Why is this important?   Participation in a range of leisure activities contributes in different ways.</description>

      <description>Raman Voranau I have nearly a decade of experience in the cultural and creative industries. I worked in the museum of arts, event agency as well as in a not-for-profit organisation, where I administrated educational projects for the early career creative workers.
In 2017–2018, I completed the MSc programme at the University of Glasgow, doing research about digital creative workers and their international mobility. Currently, I am engaged in Masters by Research course at the University of South Australia studying leisure experiences of the video game makers.</description>
