      <description>This website is dedicated to my research project undertaken at the University of South Australia. I am interviewing videogame developers to ask you about the following things:
 What does your leisure look like? What leisure activities do you prefer? What are the leisure activities valuable to you?  Why is this important?   The global health pandemic has affected work and leisure activities. It is further blurring the border between work and leisure, causing us to question the value of meaningful leisure experiences.</description>

      <description>Raman Voranau I have nearly a decade of experience in the cultural and creative industries. I worked in the museum of arts, event agency as well as in a not-for-profit organisation, where I administrated educational projects for the early career creative workers.
In 2017–2018, I completed the MSc programme at the University of Glasgow, doing research about digital creative workers and their international mobility. Currently, I am engaged in Masters by Research course at the University of South Australia studying leisure experiences of the video game makers.</description>
